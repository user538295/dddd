# Credential helper for HTTPS GitHub fetches. Reads $GITHUB_TOKEN from the

# single-quoted snippet is stored literally in git config and expanded by
# the helper shell when git invokes it). Scoped to github.com so it does
# not affect other hosts.

# Entrypoint runs in order:
#   1. Dump container env to /etc/container.env so cron jobs (which run
#      with a stripped env) can re-source it.
#   2. Start cron in the foreground inside a backgrounded subshell so
#      its own diagnostic messages reach `docker compose logs` (prefixed
#      [crond]). Crontab has 0 0 (clone) and 0 1 (refresh) only —
#      @reboot is intentionally absent; the initial clone is launched
#      directly from the entrypoint instead because @reboot in
#      /etc/cron.d/ is unreliable across container restart-vs-recreate.
#   3. Apply DB migrations (synchronously, before forking long work).
#   4. Background the initial clone (idempotent; runs every container
#      start to cover newly-added org repos).
#   5. exec into Vite. Combined with `init: true` on the compose
#      service, tini stays PID 1 and forwards SIGTERM to npm/Node.
#
# Vite is pinned to 127.0.0.1 in vite.config.ts; override with --host
# 0.0.0.0 so the port is reachable from the host.
