# Phase 00: Product Refinement And UI

Status: Draft
Last updated: 2026-05-16

## Goal

Lock the product direction, save the design history, and make the first release scope unambiguous before implementation starts.

## Decisions

- The app is a local-first web dashboard.
- The user is the Head of Engineering.
- The dashboard is for weekly decision-making, not passive reporting.
- The first release shows only PR Cycle Time.
- Future metrics are added only after their data exists.
- The app is a one-page scrolling dashboard.
- Each new metric is added as a new vertical section below the last implemented metric section.
- New metric phases preserve earlier sections above them; they do not introduce tabs, new pages, or cram additional metric cards into the first viewport.
- AI is skipped for v1.

## Mockups

### Phase 03 Reference

### Superseded Concepts

![Seven-metric MVP concept](../../Assets/mockups/02-seven-metric-mvp-concept.png)

This version is superseded because it shows too many metrics before their data collection exists.

![Expanded dashboard concept](../../Assets/mockups/01-expanded-dashboard-concept.png)

This version is superseded because it includes broader navigation, quality views, and decision areas beyond the MVP.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Product brief exists.
- Roadmap exists.
- Phase docs exist.
- Mockups are stored inside the project.
- One-page scroll layout rule is documented for future metric phases.
- Phase 01 can be implemented without re-deciding the MVP scope.
