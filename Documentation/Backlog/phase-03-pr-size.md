# Phase 03: PR Size

Status: Implemented
Last updated: 2026-05-18

Implementation plan: [FEAT-003 — PR Size](FEAT-003-pr-size-implementation-plan.md)

Depends on: [Phase 02: First Review Time](../Completed/phase-02-first-review-time.md) complete (`npm run verify:phase02`).

UI reference: [PR Cycle Time, First Review, and PR Size](../../Assets/mockups/05-pr-cycle-time-first-review-and-pr-size.png).

## Goal

Add PR Size so the dashboard can detect oversized PR patterns.

## UI Changes

- Add a **PR Size** section below the First Review Time section on the same one-page dashboard.
- Add PR Size metric card.
- Add oversized PR exceptions.
- Add 8-week PR Size trend.
- Add separate Size team breakdown.
- Show median PR size, not only maximum PR size.
- Preserve the PR Cycle Time and First Review Time sections above PR Size; do not move Phase 03 content into the first viewport.

## One-page layout rule

Phase 03 follows the project-wide one-page scroll pattern:

1. PR Cycle Time remains first.
2. First Review Time remains second.
3. PR Size is appended below First Review Time as the next scroll section.

Future metric mockups must follow the same pattern: keep existing metric sections in order and add the next metric after the last section.

## Data

Required data:

- Lines added and deleted per PR.
- File count per PR.
- Repository and team mapping.

## Acceptance criteria checklist

Verified by **FEAT-003** Task 10.1 (`npm run verify:phase03 && npm run verify:phase02 && npm run verify:phase01`).

- [x] PR Size section appears only after size data is collected (`prSize` omitted when no sized PRs).
- [x] Metric card shows median `additions + deletions` for non-null PRs in the 8-week window; shows `baseline pending` when fewer than 3 ISO weeks of size data (raw median still shown); shows period-over-period trend vs. the prior 8 weeks when enough data exists.
- [x] Oversized PR exceptions flag teams with ≥ 3 sized PRs where ≥ 50% exceed 2× team median; sorted by ratio descending; capped at 3; panel hidden when empty.
- [x] 8-week PR Size trend chart uses median lines per ISO week; null weeks are gaps, not zeros; chart renders regardless of `baselineStatus`.
- [x] Size team breakdown lists teams with ≥ 1 sized PR (columns: Team, PRs merged, Median size, Trend, Largest PR); sorted by median descending; no author names.
- [x] Size sync computes merge/squash via `git diff <sha>^1 <sha> --shortstat`; rebase via GitHub PR detail API; `changedFiles` from shortstat or API.
- [x] PRs without size data are excluded from medians (never shown as zero).
- [x] Backfill writes found SHAs to `merge_commit_sha` so future refreshes skip grep.
- [x] Phase 01 and Phase 02 surfaces unchanged (`npm run verify:phase01` and `npm run verify:phase02` pass).
- [x] `npm run verify:phase03` passes (lint, typecheck, coverage ≥ 85% on Phase 03 sources, all `@phase03` E2E tests green).
- [x] The UI does not rank or shame individual authors.

## Acceptance Criteria (reference)

Product intent (tracked completion in checklist above):

- PR Size appears only after size data is collected.
- Oversized PR exceptions are deterministic.
- The UI does not shame individual authors.
